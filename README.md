# Registration-Login App
Simple Web App where user can Register and Log into the app. A certain page can only be seen by authenticated user. So in order to see that page user has to login to the app.

###Project Overview:
I have created this project to learn user authentication using JSONWebTokens and how to implement them at backend. Also learned to hash passwords using bcryptJS.

I have also learned Handlebars(hbs) for client side template engine.

###Technology Used:

*Node.js / for javascript run time environment
*ExpressJS
*Handlebars as Template Engine
*JSON Web Tokens for authentication
*MongoDB Atlas for storing user data
*mongoose to model data
*Bcryptjs for Hashing passwords
